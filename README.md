Conversion
----------
**Not everything is converted**

Having said that, most important things *are* converted.
* Every *card* is mapped to a single *entry* in Keepass.
* All *fields* are imported;
  * Except for empty fields;
  * The field `web address` is mapped to `URL`;
  * The field `Username or email` is mapped to `UserName`;
  * All other fields are left as-is and are imported as *string field*. Those
    are visible in the detail window an by double clicking the
    entry, under the *Advanced* tab.
  * Duplicate names are solved by adding (1), (2), etc. to the name.
* *Direct logins* are imported as if their URL was a `web address` field.
